## This is the official implementation of ThermoMPNN-D, a Siamese neural network designed to predict stability changes from protein double point mutations.

[Picture Here - TODO]

This work is an extension of ThermoMPNN (https://github.com/Kuhlman-Lab/ThermoMPNN), which is itself an extension of ProteinMPNN (https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN).

### Installation


### Inference


#### Additive model
This sums the individual contributions from each single mutation without attempting to quantify epistatic coupling terms. Inference is faster.
